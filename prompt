this app is for saftey while walking in streets that:

- sets a destination where we have to go
- designate an emergency contact that the user will be called in case of emergency
-once we press start walk it will pair with the apple watch and continuously monitor the heart rate and find if the heart rate exceeds a certain limit or if not detected will dial the emergency contact immediately from the iphone where the app is running.

now i want to know if this project complies with this requirements.

if not make necessary changes and also let me know what is the bpm threshold for the emergency contact is dialed when the heart rate is detected from the apple watch.
